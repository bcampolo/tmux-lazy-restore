# Tmux Lazy Restore ðŸ¦¥âš¡ðŸ’¾ #

A tmux session manager plugin that allows sessions to be lazily restored in order to save memory and processing power, when compared to other session managers which generally restore all of your sessions at once.

********************************************************************************

## Why? ##
**There are already a bunch of tmux session managers, like tmux-resurrect.  Why did you make another one?**  
I've used tmux-resurrect for years and it's an awesome plugin, but I kept running into one major issue.  I have a separate tmux session for every project that I work on, which is around 20 different projects.  These project-based tmux sessions usually involve running Neovim, LSPs, and other processes.  This can eat up a lot of resources and usually I'm only working on one or two of those projects in any given day so loading the rest is a waste.  

So I took the next logical step and started working on a PR for tmux-resurrect to add functionality to lazily restore sessions, but then I happened upon these issues on their GitHub page and started having serious doubts as to whether or not my PR would even be considered:
- [tmux-resurrect Issue #465 (Closed - Not planned)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect/issues/465)
- [tmux-resurrect Issue #255 (Closed - User found work-around)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect/issues/255)  

So here we are: yet another tmux session manager!

********************************************************************************

## Features ##
- **Lazily Restore Individual Sessions**: A custom session-chooser allows selecting any session from the previously saved tmux sessions and only that session will be restored.  This can be a huge savings for memory and processing power.
- **Save/Update Individual Sessions**: You can save new sessions and update individual sessions without impacting all of your other sessions.
- **Easy-to-Read JSON Format**: Session files are stored in human-readable JSON files and can be updated by hand if so desired.
- **Bulk Session Operations**: Optionally Save All and/or Restore All sessions at once, similar to other tmux session managers.

********************************************************************************

## Requirements ##
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) - You can't use tmux plugins without tmux, right?
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - Allows fuzzy finding sessions to restore

********************************************************************************

## Installation Using [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
- After installing all of the prerequisites, you can add the following to you .tmux.conf file:
    ```sh
    set -g @plugin 'bcampolo/tmux-lazy-restore'
    ```

- Start tmux as usual

    ```sh
    tmux
    ```
********************************************************************************

## Key Bindings ##
- `prefix + f` - Fuzzy \[F\]ind a session and if not already loaded, restore the chosen session from the session file
- `prefix + u` - Save/\[U\]pdate the current session only to the session file
- `prefix + r` - \[R\]evert the current session to its definition in the session file 
- `prefix + X` - Delete/E\[X\]terminate the current session and remove it from session file
- `prefix + Ctrl-r` - \[R\]estore all sessions (NOTE: Does not impact current sessions that don't already exist in the file)
- `prefix + Ctrl-s` - \[S\]ave all sessions (NOTE: Does not impact sessions in the file that are not currently loaded)

### Customizing Key Bindings ###
- Add the following to your ~/.tmux.conf file after the line that adds the plugin
    ```sh
    set -g @tmux-lazy-restore-choose-key 'f'
    set -g @tmux-lazy-restore-update-key 'u'
    set -g @tmux-lazy-restore-revert-key 'r'
    set -g @tmux-lazy-restore-delete-key 'X'
    set -g @tmux-lazy-restore-restore-all-key 'C-r'
    set -g @tmux-lazy-restore-save-all-key 'C-s'
    ```

### Other Options ###
Optionally add the following to your ~/.tmux.conf file after the tmux-lazy-restore plugin line:
- Change the session file path (defaults to ~/.config/tmux-lazy-restore/sessions.json):
    ```sh
    set -g @tmux-lazy-restore-session-file '/path/to/file'
    ```
- After restoring session(s), kill the tmux session that the restore command was launched from, under the following conditions (defaults to 'off'):
    - The launching session was the only session before restoring
    - The launching session is empty (1 window, 1 pane)
    - The launching session name is numeric (usually auto-named by tmux)
    - The launching session is not the active session being restored
    ```sh
    set -g @tmux-lazy-restore-kill-launch-session 'on'
    ```
